				<div class="ui item"><p>Portland's Broadband Strategic Plan (BSP), unanimously adopted by Council in the fall of 2011, brought together city offices and community partners in the recognition that high-speed affordable broadband to every home and business represents basic infrastructure for Portland in the twenty-first century.  It means jobs, education, health care, and access to services across the digital divide - all key elements of a sustainable city.  The success of the BSP, elements of which are embedded in the Portland Plan, will have important benefits for the city’s economic development strategy, climate change strategy, and the to the continuing impact of the current economic recession.</p>

			<div class="ui item"><p>Metal Toad Mentorship Saturdays are a place for people of all skill levels and development disciplines to get help and advice on their careers and projects. It was born out of Metal Toad University where I taught a 12 week course teaching the very basics of development. My motivation back then - and today - was simply to help others start or progress in the field of web development. It evolved from the class to this group. I find that the individual attention I'm able to give to each participant to be much more helpful than the classes were.</p></div>
